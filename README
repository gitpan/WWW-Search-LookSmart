LookSmart.pm Version 2.05.


This class is a LookSmart specialization of WWW::Search.
It handles making and interpreting LookSmart searches
F<http://looksmart.com>.

I am ignoring Looksmart's categories and just parsing reviewd
sites.

LookSmart only returns 10 hits per page, less on first page
since a few are categorie links.

This class exports no public interface; all interaction should
be done through L<WWW::Search> objects.





See Also WWW::Search documentation. For all the latest
current fixed backends see:
